## Coffee-Bean is a Chrome extension for running CoffeeScript as content scripts.

I haven't put it on a Google Web Store. I'll do when this looks good.  
By now you can `git clone` this repo and install it manually.

Use `ctrl backquote` to fire it, also disable it by doing this.  
Write CoffeeScript on the left, press `alt enter` to evel the code.

There are two funcitons `puts() purge()` to write and clear.  
And `select()` function as shortcut for `document.querySelector`.  
Visit http://jiyinyiyong.github.com/coffee-bean/page/ to run the Demo.  
Note that it's a Chrome extension. Use Chrome please.
